Whether it's a community focused on a specific subject, a hobby, or a profession, Lermo enables learners to connect and collaborate effectively.

# Free and Open for Everyone

At Lermo, we believe in making education accessible to all. That's why our software is completely free and open-source for everyone to use. We aim to democratize education and provide equal opportunities for all learners.


# Business Model

While Lermo is provided free of charge, we offer additional support and infrastructure services for a nominal fee. This allows us to maintain the quality and functionality of the platform while keeping it accessible to as many users as possible.

By charging for support and infrastructure, we can ensure that Lermo remains easy to deploy and maintain, providing a seamless experience for users at an affordable price point.
